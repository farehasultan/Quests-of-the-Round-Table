## About the Project:   
Spring based , GUI application, on http://localhost:8080. GUI is implemented using JS, HTML/CSS and is manipulated throughout the game.   
- GUI interface   
- Spring based application  
- localhost (different browsers work)   

For our application, the JS files are used on the client side, for communicating with the server's GameController, and for manipulating the DOM in our user interface.  

Almost all of the game functionality is coded in Java, the functions are called from JavaScript file using Stomp Client.  

Implemented the Mediator, Strategy and Factory Patterns. More details in the final report.
