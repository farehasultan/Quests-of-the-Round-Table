# Quests-of-the-Round-Table
## About the Project:   

An implementation of a vintage board game called Quests of the Round Table created by Donna Ha, Eric Benitez and Fareha Sultan. 
Spring based , GUI application, on http://localhost:8080. GUI is implemented using JS, HTML/CSS and is manipulated throughout the game.   
For our application, the JS files are used on the client side, for communicating with the server's GameController, and for manipulating the DOM in our user interface.  
Almost all of the game functionality is coded in Java, the functions are called from JavaScript file using Stomp Client.  
Implemented the Mediator, Strategy and Factory Patterns. More details in the final report.
